  The superhero project is a project which creates multiple superheros and gives them a name, a freewill and later multiple ablilites.

  The freewill determines which hero goes first for now. Later it might do more but not for now.

  There are 4 types of abilites; support, attack, defense, and passive. 
  * Support abilites will provide buffs and debuffs. They can also change the state of an arena. Their main purpose is to change the overall state of the battle.
  * Defense ablilites are meant to delay the battle through sheilds that trigger based on certain effects. This would limit the options of the other players
  * Attack abilites will harm the other superhero and will depend on the current support and defense abilites in play. They may have some side effects, but they always have some base damage.
  * Passives are abilities that exist thoughout the whole fight, though not all of them are positive. Some heros may have a debuff to ensure that they remain balanced (ex. high damage, but attacks every other turn)

  ~Elements~
  - each ability will be assigned a element to go along with it
  * Certain elements will defeat other elements, in this case either the attack will be buffed/debuffed
  * When the stage is changed to match another element this will cause a buff or debuff based on weather the ability element matches the stage.

# --TO DO-- 

* Give abilities elements (or several elements)
* Assign stage buffs for elements 
* Allow a file to be read to produce a card
* Maybe let users create their own superhero, with an appropiate balance system
* Add more buffs/ abilities 

Future: 
* add GUI(?)
